# Welcome To Spaceship Battles!

## Gameplay
This is a local two player game where you can challenge each other for a spaceship battle in outer space. Each player picks a side and uses
the controls specified to control their spaceship. Players try to dodge each other's bullets while trying to hit the other player. The first
player whose health reaches 0 loses.

## Development
This game was built using the Python pygame library. It is a very handy tool to build games such as this, and utilizing most of what the library
offers made was greatly interesting. Check out the code to see the details of it!

## Running The Game
To run this game locally, you would need to have python installed and an IDE that runs it. Just clone the repository locally or download the 
zip file to include all the dependecies (make sure everything stays within one folder when you unzip). Unzip (extract) the file and open folder
in an IDE. Run ```main.py``` and a window with the game pops up. Enjoy!
